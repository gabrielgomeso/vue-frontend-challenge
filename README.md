## About this project
This is a simple 2023 Calendar that allows users to add reminders and shows the weather at that reminder's place and time. It's built with Vue 3 and Vite. It uses Vue 3 Options API, Pinia as state Manager, and Vitest with Vue Test Utils for testing.

I made a list of all the features implemented and general considerations about the project and code that you can find [here](https://gabigol.notion.site/Jobsity-Front-end-Challenge-0180d352caf84d09a90b4b0ae8e8cb41)
